    <li>20oz of frozen spinach</li>
    <li>1 yellow onion</li>
    <li>12oz of feta cheese</li>
    <li>1 bunch of parsley</li>

<li>Preheat oven to 325F and brush the bottom and sides of a 9x13-inch baking pan with olive oil.</li>
<!-- line breal -->
<li>Roll out the thawed phyllo dough and cover the stack with a lightly damp paper towel to keep the
dough from drying out. If dough is a lot longer than <Br>
your baking dish, cut off the end so you don't have a lot of excess dough.</li>
<!-- link breal-->
<li>Place two pieces of dough in the bottom of the pan and brush them liberally with olive oil. Repeat this layering process until just 8 sheets of dough remain.</li>
<!-- line break-->
<li>Combine the filling ingredients in a large mixing bowl then spread the mixture out on top of the dough in the pan.</li>
<!--line break-->
<li>Add the rest of the dough, brushing with olive oil every two layers as before, brushing the top layer with olive oil and adding a few drops of water to the top.</li>
<!-- line break -->
<li>Use a large sharp knife to cut through the top layer of dough (but not all the way to the bottom) in whatever size you want the end pieces to be. </li>
<!-- line break-->
<li>Bake for 1 hour or until the top layer is a nice flaky golden brown. Finish cutting the dish into pieces and serve.</li>
